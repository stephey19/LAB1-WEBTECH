            Remember the first day when I saw your face? <br />
            Remember the first day when you smiled at me? <br />
            You stepped to me and then you said to me <br />
            I was the woman you dreamed about <br />
            <p>

            Remember the first day when you called my house? <br />
            Remember the first day when you took me out? <br />
            We had butterflies, although we tried to hide <br />
            And we both had a beautiful night <br />
            <p>

            The way we held each other's hand <br />
            The way we talked, the way we laughed <br />
            It felt so good to find true love <br />
            I knew right then and there you were the one, ooh <br />
            <p>
            <b>

            I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so <br />
            I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show <br />
            When he stares at me, you see he cares for me <br />
            You see how he is so deep in love <br />
            <p>
            <b>
            <br> 
            I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious <br />
            I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts <br />
            And he's missing me if he's not kissing me <br />
            And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell it so <br />
